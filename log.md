# 100 Days Of Code - Log

<!-- ### Day 0: July 1, 2020 (Example 1) -->

<!-- **Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app. -->

<!-- **Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality. -->

### Day 2: July 2, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Took some time to work on lists and loops refresher.  Created 2 programs using loops. One that prints out the song "99 bottles of beer" on the wall and another where I changed the words to "99 days of code".  I learned how important it is to pay attention to the version of Python you are using.  The course I was taking online was using Python 2.x and I assumed it was Python 3.x because it was recently released. It caused me some issues that I could have avoided if I had checked beforehand.

**Thoughts**: Today was awesome!  I struggled a bit at the beginning but got everything working.
